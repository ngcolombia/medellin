## 📋 Meetup Form 📋

Let's create an Angular Application to manage the sign up process of the community meetups, it should send a confirmation email so attendees can know for sure it they are registered.

## ♿ Accessible Meetup ♿

Let's gather up as many strategies as we can to make Angular Medellín an accessible space for people with disabilities (visual impairment and hearing loss).
